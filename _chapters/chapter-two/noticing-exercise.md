### Let's Play!

We're going to present you with an exercise, and while you might resist it at first, trust that it's a worthwhile way to spend your time.

But first, grab a notebook or piece of paper and a writing utensil.

Our suggestion is simple: spend 5 minutes on your own, noticing your thoughts and feelings and accepting everything that comes your way.

Pay attention to what you're thinking and how you're feeling.

Make note of those feelings—but don't judge yourself or your thoughts. There's no right or wrong here—this is time for you to simply be.

What do you see?

What do you feel?

Are there sensations running through your body? *Write them down.*

Are you focused on everything you need to get done? *Write them down.*

Do you feel tense or at ease? Full or hungry? Inspired or exhausted?

Make note of each of your feelings and write down what you notice, in a stream of consciousness-style journal.

Observe and write for 5 minutes, and let yourself be present in the process.

Whatever you think and feel, remind yourself those thoughts and feelings are all okay because they're all you.

5 minutes of time spent noticing the things you typically don't even see.

That's time well spent, and time capable of bringing you into the present.

### Why It Works
When you have a million things on your mind, it's easy to get stuck in a loop just playing them back over and over again.

Writing down your thoughts and feelings breaks that loop. It gives your thoughts somewhere to live outside of your head and provides a "pressure relief valve."

This is especially helpful for task lists. When we have everything we need to get done in our head, its easy to give up and say "I have *so much* to do I'll never get it done." Then we write down the list and realise it's only ten very doable items.

Noticing our thoughts and feelings in the moment creates the emotional and mental space to percieve time as effortlessly abundant.
