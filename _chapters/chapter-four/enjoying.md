> “I finally figured out the only reason to be alive is to enjoy it.”

What brings you pleasure?

The obvious stuff comes to mind first: food, sex, and sleep (in whichever order). Then maybe some more subtle stuff: laughing at a movie, catching up with a friend, playing with your kids. Maybe even *more* subtle: the way sunlight looks on a snowy morning, your first sip of coffee, or a neatly organized workspace.

All of these pleasures, big or small, make up the positive experiences of our lives.

So why do we spend so much time doing things we don't enjoy?

Largely, it's because we're taught "that's the way it is." We all get the message that we have to work hard to get ahead. "No pain, no gain" isn't just for the gym.

Now, we're not about to do put down the importance of hard work. Most things we want to do in this world require striving, dedication, and discipline.

What we *will* disagree with is the idea that those things *have* to feel bad.

### The only difference between work and play is whether or not you *have* to do it.

You may love dancing, but if you had do it four nights a week for a paycheck it might start to feel like work super quick.

Conversely, you may hate dealing with spreadsheets, but if you're using it to plan a wedding, it may suddenly become a joyful activity.

All this does is illustrate that *joy is more of a mindset than an outcome*. Just like understanding that we are in control over how *long* time feels, learning that we're in control over how *good* it feels is the next step in eliminating time scarcity from your life for good.

We'll do this by teaching you how to focus on your own joy. Ready? Set?
