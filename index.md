## What would it feel like to have all the time in the world?

{: .lead}
Enough time to cross things off lists and enjoy leisurely activities; to no longer hurriedly rush from place to place and jump from task to task, but instead flow through your day with grace and love.

{: .lead}
The reality is: you have that time right in front of you. All you need is a little shift in perspective.

{: .lead}
**Just Stop** will guide you through exactly that.

We wrote this book as both a philosophical exploration of time in the 21st century, and a practical guide to nudging your behaviors and perspectives bit by bit. It’s written to help you shift from a place of scarcity to a place of abundance, with the intention of helping you experience time in new ways that open up new possibilities.

**And in the spirt of abundance, we're sharing the book in it's entirety online—free.** If it resonates with you, and you'd like to support us, we offer a downloadable version in PDF and eBook format.
