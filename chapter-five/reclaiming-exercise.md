### Let's play!

Set a one hour appointment with yourself next week.

Treat with the same level of deference you would a doctor's appointment or family event.

You don't have to explain to anyone what you're doing. You don't have to justify your actions. Simply set the time aside, and use it do *whatever you want*.

You want to read? Do that. You want to watch Netflix? Go for it. You want to write a page or two for your blog, call your mom, stare at the sky, or dance like a maniac? We highly encourage it.

### Why It Works
This can be a hard exercise to stick to, because so many of us have very little practice setting healthy boundaries.

But reclaiming your time—setting time aside with intention, and gently refusing to cede it—reminds you that *it's your time, and it's precious*.

The more you do this, the easier it becomes.

Set boundaries, stick to them, and revel in your newfound superpower.
